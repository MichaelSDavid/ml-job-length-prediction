# ml-job-length-prediction
A predictive model developed for ML job length prediction to support RL-based scheduler decisions, created as part of an EECS 4080 capstone project. Regressors considered are Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network, with XGBoost performing the best and generalizing well to new data.
